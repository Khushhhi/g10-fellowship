                    <p>We're exerting a pull on India's sharpest minds (think of it like a gravity well for talent) – the ones currently sharpening their intellects in the hallowed (and occasionally hollow) halls of foreign academia (Undergrad, PhD, maybe even the post-doc purgatory). The mission? A 4-month, high-intensity immersion into the engine rooms of India's most audacious DeepTech companies.</p>
                    <p>Think of it like Operation Homecoming for the Industrial Indian. Clear Objective: Inspire. Build. Return.</p>

                        <li><strong>Location + Status:</strong> You are currently navigating the academic / research labyrinth in the US, Canada, Europe, AUS or even Singapore/HK (Anywhere that is NOT INDIA, really).</li>
                        <li><strong>Stage:</strong> Currently in your Undergrad or PhD. Automatic DQ for if you're an MBA.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mindset:</strong> You possess an "insatiable urge to build." You're not just smart; you're <em>agentic</em>. You see problems and mentally prototype solutions before someone can tell you why it ain't gonna work. You might have read slightly too much Neal Stephenson or Clausewitz or Asimov. You understand that competence is common; courage and execution are rare earths. You likely find standard career paths... pedestrian.</li>

                   3. What do I get? “Four months. A stipend ($5k-ish USD). Shadowing founders. Is that the gist?"

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>That's the skeleton structure, yes. But there is more:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stipend:</strong> ~$5,000 to $10,000 USD total for the 4-month tour of duty, paid monthly (approx. $1,250 - $2,500/month). Enough to keep the lights on and the chai flowing while you're on mission.</li>
                        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Direct line. You'll shadow founders/C-suite command. Observe decision-making under fire. Understand the <em>realpolitik</em> of building hard things. 1:1 time with them so you absorb how their mental OS functions, you see hard problems being solved – and solve some yourself too.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environment:</strong> The bleeding edge. SpaceTech, AI/ML that <em>matters</em>, Robotics, maybe even things we can't list here. You'll be embedded in companies that have cleared the $5M+ funding hurdle – they have fuel in the tanks and SOLID trajectory. ([Link to companies here])</li>
                        <li><strong>The Cohort:</strong> You're not alone. You're one of ~10. A tight cadre. Expect forced collaboration, shared war stories, and the forging of alliances that could define the next decade of Indian tech. We know how hard it is to find your tribe if you are exceptional.</li>

                     <p>If you are the TLDR type: Less marching, more maneuvering.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Phase 1 (Reconnaissance – ~2 weeks):</strong> Embed. Understand the company's DNA, its market battlefield, its technological arsenal, its operational tempo. Talk to everyone – from the PhDs in the lab to the folks managing the supply chain. Identify the "idiot index" – the crucial thing <em>nobody else</em> is paying enough attention to.</li>
                        <li><strong>Phase 2 (Engagement – ~3 months):</strong> DO A PROJECT. Based on your recon, identify a bottleneck, an untapped market, a process inefficiency, a skunkworks concept the company <em>should</em> be exploring but lacks bandwidth for. Propose it. Execute it. This is your proving ground. Maybe you sit in on hiring calls, contractor negotiations, strategy sessions. You learn how the sausage - and the satellite – gets made.</li>
                        <li><strong>Phase 3 (Debriefing / Portfolio):</strong> Consolidate your findings. Produce a tangible output – a report, a prototype, a working model, something that demonstrates your contribution and learnings. This is your after-action report, your contribution to the G10 archives.</li>

                   5. Why only 10 fellows? Sounds unnecessarily exclusive.

                    <p>Precision over spray-and-pray. We're aiming for quality density, not sprawl. This is about creating a high-trust, high-impact cohort where deep bonds and cross-pollination can occur.</p>
                    <p>Think Sparta, not Persia.</p>
                    <p>Each fellow is an investment. Plus, coordinating deep access and meaningful mentorship across more than 10 becomes exponentially complex. We prefer a scalpel to a sledgehammer.</p>

                   6. "Come Home." "Nation-Building Cult." You guys sound intense. What's the ideology here?

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Intensity is the baseline. The world doesn't lack talent; it lacks <em>vectors</em>. It lacks concentrated points of force. India is at an inflection point.</p>
                    <p>We believe the next wave of foundational innovation can, and <em>must</em>, originate here. Bringing back exceptional individuals isn't just about reversing brain drain; it's about <em>critical mass</em>. It's about seeding the ecosystem with people who've seen different operational theatres and possess the drive to build monumental things <em>here</em>.</p>
                    <p>Call it a cult, call it a movement, call it applied patriotism. We call it necessary. We're tapping into tribal belonging, the desire for legacy, and the thrill of building the future. FOMO is a powerful force – miss this, and you might just miss the start of something historic.</p>

                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Network:</strong> We plug you directly into curated, high-signal communities (think Lagrange Point, Industrial47, etc.). Founder dinners, expert roundtables, off-the-record "night school" sessions with industry veterans. Factory tours that span the industrial landscape – from Surat's diamond labs to Hyderabad's aerospace corridors to Bengaluru's satellite manufacturing hubs.</li>
                        <li>Expect weekly <strong>"War Room" simulations</strong>. We throw hypothetical national crises at the cohort - supply chain collapse, cyber-attacks, resource scarcity, maybe even rogue AI (kidding... mostly). You learn to think strategically, under pressure, as a unit.</li>
                        <li>Shared housing might be arranged. Weekly dinners are mandatory. You'll build bonds with your 9 peers and meet the fellows embedded in other G10 companies. This network <em>is</em> part of the payload.</li>

                    <p>Negative. While a full-time offer might emerge (and wouldn't that be a successful mission outcome?), it's not the <em>primary</em> objective.</p>
                    <p>The goal is <em>inspiration</em> and <em>exposure</em>. We want to show you what's possible in India, connect you with the vanguard, and arm you with experience.</p>
                    <p>For everyone 10 people that tell you “this cannot be made in India", the Founders you work with, have shown, day-in and day-out that IT CAN. Talk is cheap. Seek inspiration from actual execution.</p>
                    <p>If you return to your PhD program or take a job elsewhere afterwards, but with India now firmly on your strategic map for future endeavors, that's a win. If you decide to launch your own venture here down the line... even better. This is long-cycle warfare for talent.</p>
