        <p>When you were younger, did you ever want to be a cog in the wheel of some foreign machinery? Did you not dream of inventing new things? Of finding your tribe of people working on a cause that ignites your passion? Of playing your part in history?</p>

        <h2>History is being written, real-time, at the frontier.</h2>

        <p>Space. Semiconductors. Nuclear fusion. Robots. Advanced computing.</p>
        
        <p>We Indians exhibit this perverse generosity with our own genius. While China systematically recalls 90% of its global student force, forging a national powerhouse, we champion the damn farewell party for 70% of our students studying abroad.</p> 
            
        <p>This isn't migration; it's a hemorrhage. And this passive acceptance ends now.</p>

        <p>India stands at an inflection point. The next wave of foundational innovation can—and must—originate here. Here’s your invitation to join the people forging India 2047. Not just riding shotgun, but as a copilot in the cockpit.</p>

        <p>The G10 Fellowship offers 4 months of total immersion in the engine rooms of India's most audacious DeepTech companies. No theory detached from impact. No coffee runs. You'll shadow founders and C-suite commanders, absorb their mental operating systems, and be a part of the brutal, beautiful process of building something monumental.</p>

        <h2>Your seat in the Command Center.</h2>

        <ul class="manifesto-bullets">
            <li>Direct access to India's visionary tech leaders</li>
            <li>$5K USD fellowship grant to sustain your mission</li>
            <li>A handpicked cohort of just 10 exceptional fellows, nationwide</li>
            <li>Weekly war rooms, factory floors, and strategic simulations</li>
            <li>A network of people defining the next decade of Indian innovation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You are exceptional. You deserve a greater story. The impact you can create here, back home, far exceeds what you might imagine—building the future not just for yourself, but for a billion people, and for human civilization.</p>

        <p>You have operated globally, gaining invaluable perspective and frontline exposure. This intelligence, perspective and energy is critical. It's time to redeploy that energy, that hardened expertise, back into the nation poised for breakthrough. To Build India 2047.</p>
        
        <p>Don't be another asset lost to the periphery. Here’s your 4-month long chance at being an outlier of the distribution curve, as a protagonist in the defining chapter of India's resurgence.</p>

        <a href="https://airtable.com/appQU0zWgLPP70fmz/pagHP09q6RLIdzITQ/form"><h2 class="final-call" >COME HOME</h2></a>

        <p>Hesitation isn't contemplation; it's complicity with the status quo we are sworn to shatter.</p>

        <p>Come home. Hop into the cockpit. Solve hard problems. Reverse the tide.</p>
