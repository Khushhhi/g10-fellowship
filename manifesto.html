    <main class="manifesto-content">
        <p>Have you ever wondered why we Indians exhibit this perverse generosity with our own genius? While China systematically recalls 90% of its global student force, forging a national powerhouse, we champion the damn farewell party. We've normalized the exodus, celebrating the departure of the very people who hold the keys to our ascent. Seventy percent. Think about that number. Seven out of ten of our sharpest minds, scattered abroad. This isn't migration; it's a hemorrhage.</p>

        <h2>Enough. The passive acceptance ends now.</h2>

        <p>We aren't asking anymore. We are summoning. The G10 Summer Fellowship is a mobilization order. It's the frontline call for the driven, the restless, the ones who know, deep down, that their intellect belongs to a bigger story.</p>

        <p>Forget the sanitized "internship". This is 4 months plugged directly into the engine room of India's resurgence. Shadowing the founders and C-suite commandants in the trenches of space tech, robotics, advanced compute – the battlegrounds where India 2047 is being forged. There's no room for theory detached from impact, no time for fetching coffee. This is about absorbing the velocity, understanding the chaos, witnessing the brutal, beautiful process of building something monumental.</p>

        <p>This mission is clear: Reverse the brain drain. Reclaim our future. Build India 2047. Not as a vague aspiration, but as a tangible, urgent project demanding your direct involvement.</p>

        <p>The frustration you feel? That's the fuel. The drive simmering beneath the surface? That's the ignition. This Fellowship is the conduit.</p>

        <p>So, the choice is stark, stripped bare: Remain an anonymous, replaceable gear grinding away in a foreign machine, contributing to their legacy. Or answer this call, plant your flag, and become a protagonist – a vital force – in the defining chapter of India's story.</p>

        <p>Hesitation isn't contemplation; it's complicity with the status quo we are sworn to shatter.</p>
